1. Prefix Sum - Always remember to start with 0 at index 0 and start from 1 for elements
   for i=1;i<=n;i++
   prefix[i]=prefix[i-1]+v[i]
   
2. If you want to keep track of previous result also use queue current result at front of the queue previous at the back
   if current result becomes invalid pop from front of queue and front of queue becomes previous result
