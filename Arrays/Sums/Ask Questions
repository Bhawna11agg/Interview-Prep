Does array contains only positive or negative numbers?
What if the same pair repeats twice, should we print it every time?
Is reverse of pair is acceptable e.g. can we print both (4,1) and (1,4) if given sum is 5.
Do we need to print only distinct pair? does (3, 3) is a valid pair forgiven sum of 6?
How big the array is?
