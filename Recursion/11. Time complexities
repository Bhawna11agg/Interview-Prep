Time complexity for generating subsets ---> total subsets possible 2^n and each subset has n elements
so we are visiting each element of each subset hence time complexity=O(n*2^n)

Time complexity for generating permutations---> total permuations possible n! and each permutation has n elements
so time complexity=O(n!*n)
