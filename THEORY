1.Give use cases when you will prefer Hash table instead of BST and vice-versa?
2.What happens in case of duplicate insertions in Hash table and BST. What is its effect on the complexity of search?
3. what are some algorithmic paradigm? Difference between Greedy and DP? Questions on Dijkstra(Complexity, greedy or dp). 
   And finally I was given a problem based on graph and was asked which algorithmic paradigm will be used to solve it?
   Answer was backtracking.
