Max Sum Without Adjacent Elements

Instead of digits, it was string of alphabets. There was a bug in my code. Interviewer gave me a test case and asked me to test it. Changed the approach and solved it by sorting. He asked which sorting and why? First I said merge sort because of nlogn complexity. Then I said since range is small(1-26), we can use count sort. He asked if we really need sorting? Then I said that reversing the second part was sufficient because it was in descending order.
