If order doesn't matter it means [1,2,1] and [2,1,1] and [1,1,2] treated as 1 way
If order matters then treated as 3 ways5


If order doesn't matter it means we don't have to print duplicates so first fix coins or any entity given so that duplicates
are avoided. As if we fix 1 then it can't come after 2. So we avoid duplicates.
