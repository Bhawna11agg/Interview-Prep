1. If related to array 1. Sort 2. Hash table 3. Sliding window
2. If generate/print all possible then definitely recursion
3. If find min/max of all possible then dp
4. Avoid use of pow() as much as possible
5. For finding sums or pairs with given sum sort and use 2 pointers.
6. Converting '2' to 2 --> int num='2'-'0'
7. Stoi interger to string
8. For a given element find elements to left find elements to left and compare the left,arr[i] and right
9. For segregation ie. move elements of particular type to front use quicksort approach A_23 A_24 A_25 in IMP QUES
