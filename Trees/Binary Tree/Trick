Return a pair<height,diameter> or pair<height,bool>  in tree questions to reduce the time complexity

Focus on base case usually
if(root==NULL){

  return make_pair(0,0)

}


And focus on how to return those 2 things from left subtree return value and right substree return value

See 8(2) and and 10, 13 question
